AI Dungeon is a text adventure game but unlike traditional text adventure games, which use pre-written content,[1] AI Dungeon uses artificial intelligence to generate open-ended storylines.[2][3][4]

When first beginning the game, players are greeted by the following opening:

"You're about to enter a world of endless possibilities, where you can do absolutely anything you can imagine.... Will you proceed?"[5]
Players are then prompted to choose a setting for their adventure (e.g. fantasy, mystery, apocalyptic, cyberpunk, zombies),[6][7] followed by other options relevant to the setting (such as character class for fantasy settings).[8]

After beginning an adventure, there are three main interaction methods that can be chosen for each of the player's pieces of text input:[9]

Do: Must be followed by a verb, allowing the player to perform an action.
Say: Must be followed by dialog sentences, allowing players to communicate with other characters.
Story: Can be followed by sentences describing something that happens to progress the story, or that players want the AI to know for future events.
The game's artificial intelligence allows it to adapt and respond to almost any action entered by the player.[10]

Providing blank input can also be used to prompt the AI to generate further content, and the game also provides players with options to undo/redo or modify recent events, in order to improve the game's narrative.[11] Players are also given an option to explicitly tell the AI what elements to "remember" for reference in future parts of their playthrough.[12]
